I am currently a PhD student (since Feb 2023) at the **Unversity of Stuttgart**, in the project of **IRIS3D: "Reflecting Intelligent Systems for Diversity, Demography, and Democracy"** under the supervison of [**Dr. Agnieszka Faleńska**](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Falenska/) and [**Dr. Michael Roth**](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/team/Roth-00006/). 

As a computational social scientist by training, my research interest mainly focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) ethics (demographic-awarness NLP) and computational text analysis. By making sense of the connection between language and authors' demographic information, my PhD thesis is about who are being underrepresented in NLP systems and how to amply those underrepresented voices. Questions facinating me to answer are 1. What do NLP models learn about the demographic knowledge from authors with different demographic backgrounds? 2. How does the statistical demographic bias in language messes around NLP models' decision making?
